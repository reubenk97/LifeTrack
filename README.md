# LifeTrack

## Description

This project came about because I like to look back and see how I spent my days/weeks/months. I tend to forget some random things I do in a day, so I also like using reminder apps. I wanted to consolidate both of those needs into one app, so I thought of the app LifeTrack. My hope is that it can serve as a one-stop, organized, dynamic todo-tracker app that can be used seamlessly with day-to-day life.

## Installation

Installation directions will be provided when the app is further developed.

## Usage

1. Set reminders and goals, and track their timelines.
2. Track what you did at different parts of the day and categorize them to organize them.
3. View your activity in different ways, such as daily, monthly, or yearly.

## Credits

None currently.
